- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sage4tk, I also go by Zack and I'm an aspiring front-end developer from the Philippines who's currently residing in the beautiful city of Dubai.

- 👀 I’m interested in coding with mostly front-end interest but I'm not shy to talk about new technologies 
and I'm an andrenaline junky who likes to seek adventures anywhere that can make me feel the rush!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about back-end development for the reason of how it supports the front-end views. I also want to learn more about E-commerce
and How I can implement it on my works.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any front-end projects or back-end if you can give me insight and help better each other! 😄
